# Wireframing in the Design Process

## What is Wireframing?
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a **visual blueprint or skeletal outline** of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app.  
It focuses on **layout, structure, and functionality** rather than colors, typography, or graphics.

A wireframe typically shows:
- Placement of elements like navigation bars, buttons, images, and text.
- How users will move between screens or pages.
- The overall information hierarchy and interaction flow.

Wireframes act as the **bridge between idea and design**, helping teams align on structure before adding visual design elements.

##  Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a **critical early step** in user experience (UX) and interface (UI) design because it helps teams:
- **Clarify requirements early:** Identify what needs to be built before development starts.  
-  **Enhance collaboration:** Designers, developers, and stakeholders can discuss structure and layout efficiently.  
- **Improve usability:** Focus on user flow and navigation without distraction from colors or graphics.  
-  **Save time and cost:** Catch design issues early before coding or high-fidelity design begins.

## Summary
Wireframes provide a **clear, functional representation** of a product’s structure.  
They ensure that design decisions are **intentional, user-centered, and efficient**, making them an essential tool in the product design process.
